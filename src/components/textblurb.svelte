    <p>
      In February 2020 I graduated from the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. Shortly
      there after I started my first job as a web developer at Drexel
      University; where I currently work as a frontend developer.
      I'm passionate about quality and accessible design and code. I'm also the
      proud father of a human and two cats!

      This site serves as both a portfolio to demonstrate past work and also a
      sandbox for me to play in.
