    In February 2020 I graduated from the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. Shortly
    there after I started my first job as a web developer at Drexel University;
    where I currently work as a frontend developer. I'm passionate about quality
    and accessible design and code. I'm also the proud father of a human and two
    cats!

    This site serves as both a portfolio to demonstrate recent and not so recent past work and also a
    sandbox for me to play in.
